# Fabien Mathieu

I am a Rust developer and physicist with a passion for creative computation, signal analysis, and intelligent systems.  
My background spans from theoretical physics and mathematics to applied AI and audio processing — I enjoy exploring the intersection between science, art, and technology.

## Research

**A Stochastic Model Solvable Without Integrability**  
[arXiv:2206.14473](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14473.pdf) — with Eric Ragoucy  

Explores solvable stochastic processes using the Matrix Ansatz without requiring integrability conditions.

## Creative Projects

- Music Generator — procedural composition in Rust  
- Ray Casting Engine — 2D/3D rendering experiments  

I enjoy combining mathematics, creativity, and code to build systems that are both analytical and expressive.

## Currently Exploring

- Real-time audio generation and effects  
- Machine learning entirely in Rust
